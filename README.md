# Full Stack Developer .Net
A Simple Full Stack Developer .NET C# Project

This project was created to illustrate a simple application in .NET Core.  At the time, I was looking to become more familiar with the differences between .NET and .NET Core and this project was kept simple by design to help me to learn and hopefully others to see the differences.
